Write a Java program that:

prints out a title,
requests a name from the user,
verifies the name
creates the verse or rhyme as indicated in the video,
prints out the verse, and
thank the user for using the program. 
Spend some time on formatting and make this look nice.

Special Rules:

If the name entered is your first name, print out a special message before the verse.
Certain names make this game go from the student-friendly, family-oriented game that it is intended to be, to a surprising awakening for certain people's names.  You must check first and not allow this to happen.
Mitch and Tucker are two examples.
Sound the bell when this happens (Print the character '\u0007')
Print out a friendly statement that does not allow the user to continue. Then exit.
For names with 2 consonants at the front, remove the first 2 letters. Examples are Thanos, Philip, and Steve.
For names beginning in double vowels, remove only the first vowel. An example is Aaron.
If a name you can think of doesn't fit in these rules, Print out a message that says "A little trick with (name)" then handle it as if you wrote the rules for that name.
